# Dwn-Shift

An immersive interface driving simulator. Every engine is synthesized in the
browser — no samples — so each car has its own firing order, its own crank,
and its own voice.

## Controller

Any standard Xbox or PlayStation pad. Every button on the standard layout
does something.

| Control | Xbox | PlayStation | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| Throttle | **RT** | **R2** | Analog — how hard you press is how far the pedal goes |
| Brake | **LT** | **L2** | Analog |
| Clutch | **A** | **Cross** | Held, in Manual + Clutch mode |
| Shift up | **RB** | **R1** | |
| Shift down | **LB** | **L1** | |
| Ignition | **Menu** | **Options** | **Hold** to crank — let go early and it won't catch |
| Cruise control | **B** | **Circle** | Set / cancel. Needs a forward gear and ~25 km/h |
| Auto drive | **X** | **Square** | The car takes over. Touch a pedal to take it back |
| eDrive | **Y** | **Triangle** | EV ⇄ engine on the hybrids; cabin view on everything else |
| Transmission mode | **View** | **Share** | Cycles Auto → Manual → Manual + Clutch |
| Night drive | **L3** | **L3** | Stick click |
| Cabin view | **R3** | **R3** | Stick click |
| Selector toward P | **D-pad up** | | P ← R ← N ← D, in Auto |
| Selector toward D | **D-pad down** | | P → R → N → D, in Auto |
| Previous car | **D-pad left** | | |
| Next car | **D-pad right** | | |

The triggers are properly analog: a rest deadzone so a worn pad doesn't
creep, then a curve that spreads the bottom of the pedal travel out, because
that's where all the useful control is.

## Starting a car

Not every car starts the same way.

- **Most cars** — hold the button.
- **Sant'Agata cars** (SVJ, V10 Evo, Revuelto, Urus) — flip the red cover first,
  then hold. It drops back down over the running engine, so it has to come
  up again before you can switch off.
- **Two-stage cars** (SVJ, 458, and the older stuff) — one press wakes the
  electronics, then hold to crank.
- **Older cars** (13R, MkIV, 6.2 SC, S6, M58, the diesel) — a real barrel
  lock. Key to ON, then hold it over against the spring to START.

- **Plug-in hybrids** (296, SF90, Revuelto, XM) — the button is a POWER
  button, not a starter. It wakes the car in silence on its motors; lighting
  the engine is a separate, deliberate press of **eDrive**.

Let go before it lights and the starter drops out, the engine falls back to
nothing, and the car goes back to reminding you it's switched on.

## The quiet one

The **Goodwood Phantom** is the only car in here built around not being
heard. Six-and-three-quarter litres of twin-turbo V12 making peak torque at
1700 rpm, so it never has to raise its voice — and 130kg of insulation,
double-skinned bulkheads and 6mm glass, so what little it does make doesn't
reach you.

Stand outside it and it sounds like the V12 it is. Press `V` for the cabin
and the world shuts off: the engine recedes to a weight somewhere ahead of
the bulkhead, the motorway roar stops, and you're left with a hum. That's
the `hush` property, and it's the only car that has one.

## Where you're listening from

Workshop → **WHERE YOU LISTEN**. Same engine, four microphones.

| | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Driver's seat** | Where every car in here is voiced. The default. |
| **Over the bonnet** | Induction roar, valve gear and turbo, right in front of you. The exhaust is fifteen feet behind your back, so the bass mostly isn't there. |
| **At the tailpipe** | All bass and rasp, every overrun bang going off in your face, no intake at all. The loudest place to stand and the least informative. |
| **Back seat** | Through the bulkhead and the parcel shelf. Boomy and distant — which is exactly what a chauffeur car is voiced for. |

The two outside positions genuinely are outside, so the cabin toggle does
nothing from there. You can be looking at the cabin and listening at the
tailpipe; the tailpipe wins.

The things that live inside the car with you — the chimes, the warning
tones, the indicator relay, the voice — run on their own bus that skips the
windows-up filter entirely. Sealing the car makes them **louder and
clearer**, not duller, because they were always in there with you. It's the
rest of the world that just got shut out.

## Compressor surge

`flutter` on a car is a number, not a flag, because the sound is a
consequence of plumbing. Shut the throttle under boost and the column of
pressurised air has to go somewhere:

- **No bypass valve** (the big single-turbo cars) — it slams back through a
  compressor still spinning at 130,000 rpm. The wheel stalls, the air escapes
  forward, the wheel bites again. Several separate events a second, spreading
  out and dropping in pitch as it spools down. That's the stu-tu-tu-tu.
- **A recirculating valve** (almost every factory car, for emissions reasons)
  — the air goes politely back round to the intake and all you get is the
  sigh.
- **Most cars are somewhere in between**, and do a bit of both.

All of it happens under the bonnet, so it is much quieter from inside the
car than from over the wing — and almost inaudible from the tailpipe.

## Running out

Consequences mode (workshop → **ECU & SETUP**) does three things to the car's
mechanical health. It also starts the clocks on the two things that actually
run out.

**Fuel** burns off the power the engine is genuinely making, not off elapsed
time — idling a V12 costs you almost nothing, holding it on the limiter costs
you a tank. Run dry and it doesn't switch off, it *starves*: it stumbles,
misses, and dies. After that the starter will spin all day and never catch.

**Charge** drains on what the wheels take and gives a fraction back under
regen. A plug-in tops its own pack up off the engine while it's running on
petrol, and anything sitting in **P** is on the charger.

To fill either, stop the car and use **REFUEL** in the workshop. Petrol wants
the engine switched off, the way it does anywhere with a roof over the
forecourt. Drive off mid-fill and the nozzle comes out.

With consequences **off**, nothing consumes anything — including the electric
car, which simply has no battery gauge at all until you switch consequences
on. A meter that reads 100% forever isn't a meter.
